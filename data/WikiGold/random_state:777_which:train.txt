The O
origin O
of O
Agotes B-MISC

is O
uncertain O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths B-MISC

and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O

and O
Goth B-MISC

But O
opposed O

this O
etymology O

the O

holds O
that O
the O

that O

one O
of O

he O
sensed O
his O
chances O
of O
ever O
winning O
a O
world O
title O
receding O
with O
each O
hand O
raised O
in O
opposition O
: O
he O
had O
fancied O
his O
chances O
at O
the O
infamous O
Island B-LOC

Retreating O
to O
his O
car O
, O
he O
broke O
down O
and O
cried O
, O
angered O
and O
frustrated O
by O
his O
peers O
' O
reluctance O
to O
man O
up O
at O
a O
spot O
that O
has O
always O
rewarded O
the O

He O
paddled O
out O

, O
an O
overt O
display O
of O
defiance O
against O
the O
group O

decision O
- O
albeit O
a O
failed O
one O
. O
 
" O
I O
ended O
up O
cutting O
my O
hand O
pretty O
badly O
on O
the O

It O
was O

rideable O
at O
all O

" O
 
Six O
months O

was O
in O
Hawaii B-LOC
in O
January O

for O
the O
final O
stop O
on O
the O
world O
tour O
. O
 
The O
irony O
of O
that O
frigid O
afternoon O
in O
Cronulla B-LOC
did O
n't O
dawn O
on O
Player B-PER
as O
he O
paddled O
out O
in O
flawless O
, O
two-metre O
waves O
for O
the O
final O
of O
the O
Pipeline B-MISC
Pro B-MISC
; O
he O
was O
too O
preoccupied O
with O
matters O
at O
hand O
. O
 
After O
further O
tour O
stops O
in O
Chile B-LOC
, O
Portugal B-LOC
and O
Maui O
, O
the O
two O
riders O
left O
in O
the O
hunt O
for O
the O
2006 O

were O
the O
same O
pair O

in O

going O
ahead O
at O
Shark B-LOC
Island B-LOC
- O
Ben B-PER

Queenslander B-MISC
Mitchell B-PER
Rawlins B-PER
. O
 
With O
Rawlins B-PER
knocked O
out O
in O
the O
quarters O
, O
Ben B-PER
needed O
to O
place O
at O
least O
second O
in O
the O
final O
to O
realise O
his O
dream O
of O
becoming O
world O
champ O
. O
 
His O
surfing O
in O
that O
30-minute O
final O
was O
truly O
world O
class O
, O
combining O
clean O
barrels O
with O
solid O
boosts O
. O
 
Ben B-PER
opened O
up O
a O
lead O
early O
that O
he O
would O
hold O
on O
to O
through O
to O
the O
siren O
. O
 
Not O
just O
the O
master O
of O
Pipeline B-MISC
, O
but O
champion O
of O
the O
world O
... O
 
Then O
, O
further O
controversy O
. O
 
In O
the O
hazy O
, O
backlit O
conditions O
of O
the O
late O
afternoon O
, O
it O
was O
revealed O
that O
the O
judges O
had O
confused O
the O
riders O
, O
awarding O
Player B-PER
the O
points O
for O
a O
ride O
his O
opponent O
had O
made O
. O
 
Scores O
were O
hastily O
revised O
, O
then O
the O
gutting O
news O
: O
Player B-PER
had O
been O
relegated O
to O
runner-up O
, O
just O
moments O
before O
he O
was O
due O
to O
be O
presented O
with O
the O
Pipeline B-MISC
trophy B-MISC
. O
 
The O
confusion O
soured O
the O
occasion O
. O
 
But O
Ben B-PER
Player B-PER
was O
bodyboarding O
's O
newest O
world O
champion O
. O
 
This O
month O
Player B-PER
returns O
to O
Hawaii B-LOC
to O
defend O
his O
title O
. O
 
No O
such O
contest O
debacles O
this O
year O
, O
which O
means O
Ben B-PER
Player B-PER
is O
more O
ambitious O
than O
ever O
to O
win O
it O
clean O
. O
 
And O
again O
it O
will O
all O
come O
down O
to O

, O
where O
his O
performances O
every O
winter O
since O
he O
first O
arrived O
as O
a O
wiry O
16-year-old O
have O
made O
him O
a O
stand O
out O

what O

, O
as O
even O
the O
greatest O

on O

" O

" O
He O
does O
n't O
really O

all O
that O
much O

seems O
to O
get O
the O

right O

a O
good O

" O
 
That O
wiry O

filled O
out O
during O

13 O

spent O
hassling O

converge O
on O

with O

a O

half O
the O

constantly O

something O

talent O

drive O
. O
 
" O
The O
fact O
Toby B-PER

more O

Ben B-PER

biography O
reflects O
the O
twists O
and O
turns O
of O
the O
phenomenal O
growth O
of O
this O
comparatively O
new O
sport O
. O
 
Player B-PER
won O
Australian B-MISC
titles O
as O
a O
cadet O
( O
under-16s O
) O
and O
as O
a O
pro O
in O
2000 O
, O
part O
of O
the O
new O
generation O
that O
reshaped O
bodyboarding O
in O
Australia B-LOC
. O
 
This O
crew O
put O
new O
emphasis O
on O
style O
and O
fluidity O
in O
big O
moves O
and O
heavy O
situations O
, O
keeping O
their O
bodies O
and O
legs O
tight O
and O
in O
control O
through O
monstrous O
airs O
, O
milking O
power O
out O
of O
the O
pocket O
of O
the O
wave O
-- O
the O
bowl O
that O
forms O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barrelling O
section O
. O
 
His O
progressive O
riding O
and O
surfer-good O
looks O
made O
him O
the O
complete O
package O
, O
but O
at O
24 O
, O
when O
he O
might O
have O
been O
cashing O
in O
, O
his O
seat O
at O
the O
head O
of O

kicked O
out O

him O

At O
the O

pulling O
out O

pulled O

lost O

Mike B-PER

-- O
the O
undisputed O
guru O
of O

who O
had O
pioneered O
the O

-- O
for O
kick-starting O
an O
era O
of O
self-reliance O

self-belief O
, O
backed O
by O
his O
call O
to O
" O

those O
who O
support O
bodyboarding O
" O
. O
 
A O
kind O
of O
evangelistic O
patriotism O
swept O
through O
the O
sport O
. O
 
First O
came O
the O
launch O
of O
bodyboard-specific O
clothing O
brands O
, O
then O
wetsuits O

accessories O
. O
 
Now O
bodyboarding O
specific O

have O
opened O

for O
the O
newly O
independent O
industry O
. O
 
" O
The O
sport O
is O
in O
a O
much O
better O
position O
now O
, O
" O
Player B-PER
will O
tell O
you O
. O
 
" O
It O
's O
still O
growing O
, O
but O
with O
the O
money O
remaining O
in O
bodyboarding O
. O
" O
 
The O
thought O
of O
quitting O
never O
entered O
his O
head O
. O
 
" O
It O
was O
more O
a O
question O
of O
' O
How O
am O
I O
going O
to O
make O
ends O
meet O
? O
" O
 
He O
'd O
always O
harboured O
a O

streak O
, O
was O
an O
avid O
scribe O
within O
the O
sport O
and O
a O
self-taught O
graphic O
designer O
... O
The O
answer O
seems O
obvious O
now O
: O
Player B-PER
pooled O
the O
last O
of O
his O
savings O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
and O
launched O
a O
magazine O
. O
 
" O
The O
only O
other O
bodyboarding O
magazine O
on O
the O
market O
was O
aimed O
at O
a O
young O
teenage O
audience O
, O
and O
here O
I O
was O
20-something O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
relate O
. O
 
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
something O
I O
could O
show O
people O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Hey O
, O
this O
is O
what O
I O
do O
. O
' O
" O
 
For O
the O
first O
two O
years O
Player B-PER
sold O
advertising O
for O
the O
mag O
, O
which O
was O
named O
Movement B-ORG
. O
 
It O
now O
employs O
four O
people O
( O
yes O
, O
including O
this O
author O
) O
. O
 
Player B-PER
's O
been O
able O
to O
step O
away O
from O
the O
day-to-day O
business O
, O
but O
the O
magazine O
is O
a O
venture O
that O
will O
keep O
him O
firmly O
rooted O
in O
the O
sport O
. O
 
It O
has O
even O
re-energised O
his O
passion O
for O
the O
sport O
. O
 
" O
The O
more O
I O
worked O
on O
Movement B-ORG
the O
more O
stoked O
I O
became O
on O
bodyboarding O
again O
. O
" O
 
As O
the O
street O
cred O
of O
bodyboarding O
evolved O
, O
so O
did O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
sport O
. O
 
Bodyboarders O
now O
seek O
out O
the O
sort O
of O
aquatic O
slabs O
breaking O
in O
shallow O
water O
that O
stand-up O
surfers O
leave O
alone O
. O
 
" O
On O
a O
bodyboard O
you O
can O
handle O
much O
steeper O
situations O
. O
 
Being O
prone O
means O
you O
can O
ride O
over O
very O
shallow O
, O
ledging O
reefs O
, O
sometimes O
just O
inches O
deep O
, O
where O
you O
wo O
n't O
get O
knocked O
off O
by O
steps O
in O
the O
wave O
. O
" O
 
This O
extreme O
element O
comes O
with O
heavy O
consequences O
. O
 
During O
a O
contest O
in O
Tahiti B-LOC
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
Player B-PER
pulled O
into O
a O
barrel O
that O
shut O
down O
on O
him O
. O
 
When O
he O
finally O
came O
up O
for O
air O
, O
he O
was O
bleeding O
from O
both O
ears O
from O
the O
sheer O
pressure O
exerted O
by O
the O
imploding O
wave O
. O
 
" O
I O
think O
surfing O
actually O
embraces O
bodyboarding O
much O
more O
now O
, O
because O
it O
's O
not O
really O
seen O
as O
competition O
-- O
we O
're O
something O
totally O
different O
, O
" O
he O
says O

" O
We O
're O

own O

and O
we O
've O
got O
our O

The O
